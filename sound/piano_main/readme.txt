[University of IOWA : Electronic Music Studios]
Please consider making a tax-deductible donation to fund the next phase of this project. Beginning in 2012, instruments are being recorded at 24/96 with three mics for mono and stereo files that are archived into Zip files. For online listening, these notes are also organized into 16/44.1 chromatic scale files. Each instrument in the collection will be re-recorded with a variety of articulations, legato, glissandi, multiphonics, extended techniques, and in combination with other instruments. New instruments, such as the recently added guitar, will also be recorded. These freely available recordings have been used by countless musicians and in over 270 research papers. When making a donation, please write "Electronic Music Studios" in the comments field.
